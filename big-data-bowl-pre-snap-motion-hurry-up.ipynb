This is in line with conventional football knowledge: one of the main reasons for running motion in the first place is to identify when the defense is playing man coverage, and man coverage is typically easier to beat if you know it's coming, relative to zone. If the defense is in man and a receiver motions before the snap, a defensive player will follow them, and that can give the defensive coverage away.\n\nHowever, even in zone coverage, running motion has a significant improvement on performance *when the team is not in a hurry up situation*. The p-value for both man and zone coverage in non-hurry-up situations is below 0.05, and there is a positive change in EPA per play as well. However, in hurry up situations, the p-values are all above 0.05. This suggests we are not seeing any significant effect of motion there, even in man coverage, which is supposed to be the main source of its success.

These situations have significant positive changes when motion is run in normal situations, but not in hurry up situations. In fact, it is difficult to find any disaggregation of the data where there is a significant effect of motion on team success in hurry up situations.\n\nRunning motion seems to help teams more when they run a traditional dropback, rather than a designed rollout or run. Scrambles by definition are unplanned, so it's difficult to make conclusions about how teams could change their strategy based on that data.

The exception to this is the 3x2 alignment, but this actually leads to a negative change when you run motion. I'm pretty sure that this alignment in a hurry up situation would basically only used in desperate times where the offense is using as many receivers as possible and just trying to throw the ball as far as possible, so I wouldn't draw any large conclusions from that. We see pretty substantial improvements in normal situations when using motion across the board, with the largest changes coming in 2x2 and 3x2 alignments.
