MPCS 51042 / Big Data Bowl

The [NFL Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025) is a competition to see who can make the best models analyzing professional football data. The theme this year is using pre-snap motion data (what happens before the snap) to "generate creative insights and actionable predictions into what the offense or defense does after the snap". I am designing models to determine the efficiency of running motion in a no-huddle offense (when the team with possession is under time stress due to the specific game conditions). This can also include analyzing which teams are best at running motion in these situations, which teams are best at countering it on defense, and looking at which types of players benefit the most from it.
