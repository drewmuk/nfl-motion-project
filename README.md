MPCS 51042 / Big Data Bowl

The [NFL Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2025) is a competition to see who can make the best models analyzing professional football data. The theme this year is using pre-snap motion data (what happens before the snap) to "generate creative insights and actionable predictions into what the offense or defense does after the snap". I plan on designing models to determine the efficiency of running motion in a no-huddle offense (when the team with possession is under time stress due to the specific game conditions). This can also include analyzing which teams are best at running motion in these situations, which teams are best at countering it on defense, and looking at which types of players benefit the most from it.

Project plan:

By the end of week 4, I want to have a model set up that predicts some metric of success on no-huddle plays based on the motion they use pre-snap.
By the end of week 5, I want to visualize this data, refine the model, and add some extra features like separating the data by type of player.
By the end of week 6-7, I want to have a good understanding of how defenses react to motion, and add a model that describes this behavior to my findings in a meaningful way. I also want to start forming a thorough conclusion about what to make of the data by this point.
By the end of week 8, I want to have my write-ups essentially done and have enough visualizations to support the conclusions I'm drawing. I should be able to explain the statistics and modeling techniques I used, and have the visualizations make sense given the context.
By the end of week 9, I want to have a fully finished product that uses intermediate/advanced Python techniques and could potentially be useful for NFL game planning in time-pressured situations. The guidelines for the competition are to contain no more than 2,000 words and less than ten tables/figures, so I'll refine the notebook to fit these standards.
